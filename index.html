        El animal criogato es una especie de mamífero que habita en las regiones árticas. Se caracteriza por su cuerpo cubierto de pelo blanco y sus extremidades muy largas, 
        lo que le permite moverse con facilidad en la nieve. Además, posee una capa de grasa que le protege del frío y le permite almacenar energía para los períodos de 
        inactividad.

Poderes sobrenaturales: 
El animal criogato posee la capacidad de sobrevivir a temperature tan bajas como -60°C. Además, es capaz de dormir durante largos periodos de tiempo (hasta 8 meses) sin necesidad de comer. 
Debido a sus características físicas y a su capacidad de sobrevivir en condiciones extremas, el animal criogato se ha utilizado en numerosos experimentos de criogenia.
